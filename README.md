Customer Analytics and RFM Segmentation (SQL Project)
Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end customer analytics workflow using SQL.
Starting from a raw transactional sales table, the database was normalized into a structured relational model including:
•	Customers
•	Products
•	Orders
•	Order Items
The goal was to transform raw sales data into actionable business insights, including:
•	Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
•	RFM Segmentation (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
•	Customer Retention Metrics
•	Identification of high-value churn-risk customers
Data Modeling
The original single sales table was normalized into four tables:
•	customers
•	products
•	orders
•	order_items
Key concepts applied
•	Primary & Foreign Keys
•	Data normalization
•	Relational joins
•	Data migration from raw table to structured schema
Key Business Analysis Performed
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
Calculated total revenue generated by each customer using SUM (quantity * price). This identified the highest revenue-generating customers.
RFM Analysis
Customers were segmented based on:
•	Recency – Days since last purchase
•	Frequency – Number of orders
•	Monetary – Total spend
Using NTILE (5), customers were scored from 1–5 across each dimension and grouped into segments such as Champions, Loyal Customers, Big Spenders at Risk, Churn Risk, Average Customers.


Repeat Purchase Rate
Calculated percentage of customers with more than one order to measure retention performance.
Business Insights
•	A small group of customers generated a disproportionately high share of total revenue.
•	Several high-monetary customers showed low recency scores, indicating potential churn risk.
•	Repeat purchase rate highlighted the importance of retention strategies over pure acquisition.
Skills Demonstrated
•	Advanced SQL joins
•	Window functions (NTILE)
•	Aggregations and grouping
•	Customer segmentation logic
•	Relational schema design
•	Data transformation & migration
